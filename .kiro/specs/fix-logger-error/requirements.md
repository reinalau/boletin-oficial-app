# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing a `NameError: name 'logger' is not defined` error during lambda function execution. This error occurs in the `config_service.py` file where `logger.error()` is called without proper import or initialization. This issue prevents the application from running correctly and needs to be resolved to ensure proper error handling and logging throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to handle logging errors gracefully without crashing, so that the lambda function can execute successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the config service encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error without causing a NameError
2. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL have proper logging configuration available to all services
3. WHEN an error occurs in config loading THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages without crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent logging throughout the application, so that I can debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any service needs to log information THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent logging interface
2. WHEN logging is used in any module THEN the system SHALL ensure proper logger imports and initialization
3. WHEN the application runs in Lambda environment THEN the system SHALL configure logging appropriately for AWS CloudWatch

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the error handling to be robust, so that configuration errors don't prevent the application from providing useful feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration loading fails THEN the system SHALL use the error_handler utility consistently
2. WHEN a logger is not available THEN the system SHALL have fallback error reporting mechanisms
3. WHEN the application encounters logging issues THEN the system SHALL not crash but continue with degraded functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run local tests successfully, so that I can verify the application works before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `python tests/test_lambda_local.py` THEN the system SHALL execute without NameError exceptions
2. WHEN the lambda function is invoked locally THEN the system SHALL initialize all services successfully
3. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate and log configuration status properly
